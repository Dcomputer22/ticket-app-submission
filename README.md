## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete ticket management system with identical functionality across three different frontend frameworks:

### Core Features

**Landing Page**: Hero section with wavy SVG background and decorative circles
**Authentication**: Secure login and signup with form validation
**Dashboard**: Real-time ticket statistics (total, open, in-progress, closed)
**Ticket Management**: Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
**Form Validation**: Real-time validation with inline error messages
**Protected Routes**: Authentication-required pages with automatic redirects
**Session Management**: Persistent login using localStorage/PHP sessions
**Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
**Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support

### Design Consistency

All three implementations share:

- Identical layout and component structure
- Same color scheme and status indicators (green/amber/gray)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Uniform navigation and footer across all pages
- Max-width 1440px centered layout on large screens
